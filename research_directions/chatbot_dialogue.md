### Connections with QA
[Conversational Question Answering: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.00874)
[A Survey on Multi-hop Question Answering and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.09140)
[Iterative Hierarchical Attention for Answering Complex Questions over Long Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.00200) - to answer question we need to have answers on multiple smaller questions(this can be seen as multi-turn). this answers update our "main" query that helps answer initial question
  
### Retrieval-Augmented LM
[Few-shot Learning with Retrieval Augmented Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03299) - RETRO model with better training. Good source of knowledge how to make retrieval-augmented models
[Language Models that Seek for Knowledge: Modular Search & Generation for Dialogue and Prompt Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13224) - SeeKer model outperforms BlenderBot2 on open-domain dialogue conversation
