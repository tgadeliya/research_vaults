Collections of papers and notes for planning research and pet projects

### Structure
**notes** - mostly collection of notes from different papers/posts and more common notes from tutorials and workshops.

**research directions** - more organized collections of papers and notes with backlog to read and different research directions. 
This can contains some comment, ideas based on paper or more abstract thoughts
Every research direction should contain papers on theme, backlog with TODOs on this concrete topic. Not every research direction should be last forever, some research directions can be bored or due to lack of time forgotten. It's OK


**research_projects** - contain concrete ideas that described enough to start do something practical. Not every research_direction should have dedicated research_projects (and vice versa) and some directions can have multiple research_projects. If project is "in progress", should be link to place when the progress is tracked
