This main aim of this work to research how parametric and non-parametric memory interact through extracting properties on examples


Hypothesis:
- While parametric and non-parametric memory contains conterfactual facts, model rely on parametric memory
- We can control extent of model usage of parametric and non-parametric memory
- Contrfactual facts in parametric and non-parametric memory influence model confidence on tasks


Idea:
- Whether model memorize facts from retriever during training
- Test pre-traiined on QA task and without models, to see what changes during training. 
- Think about geographic aspect and time. Which memory more influenced by this aspects
- Use change in probability as measure of model confidence
- We can develop method to make model rely on parametric or non-parametric memory
- Research on encoder and decoder memory of BART
- Use FiD and RAG models
- Search datasets with contfactual QA
