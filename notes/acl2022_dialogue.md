Dialog:
- [Internet-Augmented Dialogue Generation](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.579/) - replace Internet with internal ecosystem and we will strong taks oriented chatbot, that can solve problems
- [Online Semantic Parsing for Latency Reduction in Task-Oriented Dialogue](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.110/) - parse (can be incomplete) user utterances into executable sequences of programs. Interesting approach to interact with other build-in systems
- [Multi-Task Pre-Training for Plug-and-Play Task-Oriented Dialogue System](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.319/)
- [Achieving Conversational Goals with Unsupervised Post-hoc Knowledge Injection](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.224/) - similar method can be used while training TOD with knowledge augmentation 
- [DialFact: A Benchmark for Fact-Checking in Dialogue](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.263/) - semi-automatic dataset creation and evaluation process potentially can be useful.   
- [The AI Doctor Is In: A Survey of Task-Oriented Dialogue Systems for Healthcare Applications](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.458.pdf) - Take a lokk on models from medicine, because they should be factual. The same property is very important during TOD
- [Incorporating Medical Knowledge to Transformer-based Language Models for Medical Dialogue Generation](https://aclanthology.org/2022.bionlp-1.10.pdf)- solving problem on knowledge injection. They use graph
- [ProphetChat: Enhancing Dialogue Generation with Simulation of Future Conversation](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.68.pdf) - It is useful to have system that can predict future questions from user. E.g. performing search in advance
- [UniGDD: A Unified Generative Framework for Goal-Oriented Document-Grounded Dialogue](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-short.66.pdf) - Propose pipeline where we generate knowledge useful for response and after that generate response
- [Data Augmentation and Learned Layer Aggregation for Improved Multilingual Language Understanding in Dialogue](https://aclanthology.org/2022.findings-acl.160/)
- [Retrieval-Free Knowledge-Grounded Dialogue Response Generation with Adapters](https://aclanthology.org/2022.dialdoc-1.10.pdf)- Train adapters instead of retrieval component. Adapters learn prior knowledge


Datasets:
- [GlobalWoZ: Globalizing MultiWoZ to Develop Multilingual Task-Oriented Dialogue Systems](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.115/) 

Evaluation:
- [Achieving Reliable Human Assessment of Open-Domain Dialogue Systems](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.445.pdf) - human assesment + some defined categories that can be adapted
- [Probing the Robustness of Trained Metrics for Conversational Dialogue Systems](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-short.85/)

Task 
[DialDoc 2022 Shared Task: Open-Book Document-grounded Dialogue Modeling](https://aclanthology.org/2022.dialdoc-1.18.pdf)- seems to be highly relevant.
