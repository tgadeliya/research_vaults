In this series of presentations (blogsposts) I will try to give a broad, but not very deep (especially in particular topics) overview of Question Answering domain in NLP.

In he beginning I would like to talk about the nature of the problem and interesting consequences (?) of this nature. We use different models to complete different tasks, but humans have one brain to rule them all. So key of that ingredient is unversality. In this case this is a language. We use language to obtain knowledge and solve non-physical problems (???), without extra source of task. And QA is universal tool to learn new. We can see that as universal tool. You can ask about translation, about summarization and so on (picture with example).  In we try to generalize more, we can say that every question-answer pair is a special case of dialog, so dialog is more basic problem to solve. using this analogy, we can see that solving QA problem (in broad sense learning to give adequate response to every question) it is road to AI (in modern, fantastic or other ways) through NLP.
(Add: QA and chat as universal **FORM** of presentation to a lot of problems)


We can see influence of that idea in different papers
(picture with below papers) (Add short story)
(Add about complex structure of NLP Decathlon and T5 simple approach)
(Decathlon used question as base, T5 used dialog as base. Kinda artificial, but dialog. T0?)
- Meta learning when we pass task as something new  (task t)
- Ask Me Anything:  Dynamic Memory Networks for Natural Language Processing
- NLP Decathlon
- T5
- T0


Now going to more consice(?) definitions
Question Answering in area of research focusing on answering questions. But questions can be different form and content. So we need to talk about taxonomy of problems QA 
My idea is to present you this taxonomy through chronological dataset survey (not extensive, but obtaining almost all, if is not all, categories of QA). I simultaneously, really short history of QA will be presented. If you would like to learn more about history of QA and other staff, I suggest you watch/read tutorial from ACL2020(link). 

Why I am using datasets? I think this is good illustration of progress  and chalenges in QA. Because data incredibly important in machine learning and I deeply believe that datasets shapes the form (models, approaches, ideas imerged from analysing data in datasets)
